1) Creating a IAM with administration access of all elasticservices.
2) Open ECS and create a cluster with EC2 inux + Networking
	next step: Cluster Name* <some name>
	click on CREATE

It will create a EC2

once cluster is created open the cluster and click on ECS Instances (option) to view EC2


3) Open ECR and create a Repositorieswith you custom define name.
Once you created the Repositorie you you can see URi for that Repositorie now we need to push our docker image to the created Repositorie.

4 commands to push the image to ECR.(Windows)
 ...> aws ecr get-login-password --region ap-south-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin  505398100475.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com
 ...> docker build -t kirandockerregister .
 ...> docker tag kirandockerregister:latest 505398100475.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/kirandockerregister:latest
 ...> docker push 505398100475.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/kirandockerregister:latest

Once we completed pushing the image we can see out image and imageURl and then we need to create Task definitions

..> custom task name
..> select EC2
..> provide memory and CPU 
..> Adding Container
---> provide container name and copy paste the image url which we will get from ECR (created repo).
Once we created we need to create a service for the task 

Actions --> we can find create service.
